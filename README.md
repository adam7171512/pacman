**Pacman**

A pacman game created as a university project. 

As per requirements, game was implemented fully using Java Swing, with playing board based on JTable (with custom TableModel).

Implementation includes algorithmic maze-generation of size specified by user, various pacman upgrades and animations.

Items can change pacman's speed, score multiplier, lives, make him invincible and they can also freeze enemies, or blow them up. They also influence visual presentation of the playing board ("Numbers" change graphics to just digits and "Flip" flips the board upside down) for certain period of time. Some items also change path-finding algorithm for sprites (to move towards the pac, or run away from). When the user collects all food from the board, new maze gets generated.
